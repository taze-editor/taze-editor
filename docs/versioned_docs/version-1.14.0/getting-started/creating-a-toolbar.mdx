Here is a simple example of how to create a toolbar. You can see the component
files in the code editor under.

:::note

Currently we do not provide a design system, components or any style utilities
in `taze`. So, you can use any library for styling components. We have used
CSS-in-JS library called ðŸŽ¨ [**desygna**](http://github.com/desygna/desygna/) ðŸŽ¨
in those examples.

:::

import { CreatingToolbar } from "./CreatingToolbar";

<CreatingToolbar />
