[Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) is a low-level editor framework
that helps you deal with difficult parts when building an editor.

Taze Editor is built on top of Slate and _heavily inspired by
[Plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate)._ üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® We have used most of the
utilities and types from Plate. So we are grateful both Slate and Plate
contributors.

Taze Editor provides a set of functions to help you build a rich text editor.
It's a good starting point for you to build your own highly **customizable** and
**extensible** editor. Also, there are many ready-to-use plugins.

We have been working on implementing a `store` API that based on individual
plugins and combined (e.g. each plugin's store that used by editor) for Taze
Editor.

We are still in the early stage of development, so there are many things to
implement. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to
contribute.
